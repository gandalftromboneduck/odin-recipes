    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>This pho lemongrass soup is served with a plate full of fresh garnishes and various sauces â€” this allows each
        person to season their serving to taste. The soup is somewhat unusual because the meat is cooked in the serving
        bowl. The beef is sliced very thin, almost thin enough to see through; you might want to have the butcher slice
        it. The boiling hot broth is poured over the noodles and raw meat. The meat is quickly cooked in the hot broth
        while you garnish the soup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>6 slices fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 lemon grass</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 pound sirloin tip, cut into thin slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine broth, onion, ginger, lemongrass, cinnamon, and peppercorns in a large pot. Bring to a boil, reduce
            heat, and cover. Simmer for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Arrange bean sprouts, basil, mint, and cilantro on a platter with peppers and limes.</li>
        <li>Soak noodles in hot water to cover until soft, about 15 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Place equal portions of noodles into 6 large soup bowls; place raw beef on top. Ladle hot broth over noodles
            and beef. Serve alongside hoisin, hot pepper, and fish sauces; pass platter with garnishes.</li>
    </ol>
